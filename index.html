		<h1>BOXKID VS THE OCEAN</h1>
		<p>
			<em>Boxkid vs. the Ocean</em> is a webcomic that is currently in development by <a href="flare145.com" rel="no_opener" target="_blank">FLARE145</a>. It will feature a character named Boxkid as he tries to do anything at all. The comic will hosted here in a 1:1 square page format, but it will likely be posted on webtoon as well in a scrolling format. This is a story that is <em>not written from the start</em>, meaning that unlike many of my other projects, I'm not quite sure how it ends. This is a very low risk project but I will still put plenty of efort into it, so I hope you enjoy.

			I'm currently posting most of my ideas for this comic on my twitter. Scroll around and you might see something cool.
