		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			<em>Boxkid vs. the Ocean</em> is a webcomic that is currently in development by <a href="https://flare145.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FLARE145</a>. It will feature a character named Boxkid as he tries to do anything at all. The comic will hosted here in a 1:1 square page format, but it will likely be posted on webtoon as well in a scrolling format. This website is still a work in progress so don't be confused when something doesn't work or seems unfinished. I'm trying to stay really casaul about this project but I will still put plenty of effort into it, so I hope you enjoy.

		<h2>Preview</h2>

			Here are some drawings I've made related to Boxkid. These may contain spoilers so they will be hidden once the series actually begins. Note that this is already very similar to what actual panels will

		<h2>When will it release?</h2>
		<p>At some point this year. I wish I could be more specific but the truth is that I don't know how long it will take me to get everything set up the way I'd like it in order to start. I want to figure out how the website will be organized and the way in which chapters will be released. Everything should be sorted out before I start, but after that, I hope to make the comics pretty quickly.</p>

		<h2>Design details</h2>
		<p>There are a few rules I'd like to follow to make this comic unique. The first is that Boxkid cannot be drawn digitally. The style will be very loose and sketchy. I will probably compose the panels digitally, but most stuff, especially the characters, must be drawn on paper. The concept images that I showed are essentially what fully rendered panels could look like. This allows me to stay more casual about this project in my mind, so that I don't suddenly balloon this into something really ambitious. It's also just kind of cool? For similar reasons, color is to be used very sparingly.</p>
		<p>I mentioned this earlier without explaining well, but the comic will be composed on square pages. Not the standard comic book page size. I think this will be an interesting way to make it more unique, and it's also a fun gimic because box. I'll probably make a scrolling version too. If I do, I want to make it so you can select your preference on this website, but the square pages one is like the canonical one.</p>
		<h2>Story details</h2>
		<p>Okay so I obviously don't want to spoil a bunch of cool story ideas, but I want to try to explain the vibe of what the comic even is. Basically, I wanted to make something kind of stupid and fun, but I accidentally thought about it too much and it got kinda sad. So if I had to describe it, I would say its kind of sad but ultimately a little hopeful and inspirational. I really like this character though. Like always, any character I come up with is in some way related to me, but something about this character feels really special compared to some of my other ones. I think it might be because it's the character that is least directly me, but also feels like a unique type of protaginist in general? So it feels like they're really real to me. Hopefully you'll see what I mean or maybe I'm just cooking nothing. This project can go in any direction and that's really exciting to me.</p>-->
